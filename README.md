# Sleepaway-Character-Sheets
Sleepaway (by Jay Dragon): Character Sheets for Roll20
This project started 2/18/2021 to work on digitizing the character sheets used for Sleepaway (A belonging-outside-belonging RPG by Jay Dragon)

Sleepaway can be purchased here: https://possumcreekgames.itch.io/sleepaway

Offseason (an online supplement for Sleepaway) can be purchased here: https://possumcreekgames.itch.io/offseason-sleepaway

Please note I do not own the rights to these games, while I have purchased them for my own personal use, I am merely creating an easier way for my friends and myself and others who own this game to be able to play online with an easier way of using their character sheets!
